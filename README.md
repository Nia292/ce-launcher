# Conan Exiles Launcher
Just a launcher for Conan Exiles that patches your modlist for you. Has the feature to connect to a server and, optionally, update all your mods before it does. 

# Installation
Head over to the releases tab. Download the latest version.

You may be prompted to download and install a .NET desktop runtime. Follow the steps instructed when it happens. 

# My server isn't listed
The launcher pulls servers from here: https://github.com/Nia292/ce-server-list/blob/main/servers.json

Your server admin needs to get in touch with me, ideally via the TW mod discord or directly (@nia2424), then I can add the server there.
